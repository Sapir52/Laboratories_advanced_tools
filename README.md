Lab 3: object_detection_and_cropping

daraSet: The COCO dataset has been developed for large-scale object detection, captioning, and segmentation. The 2017 version of the dataset consists of images, bounding boxes, and their labels

steps:
  1. Object detections in the images, using the detectron2 library.
  2. Use Hough Line Transform to get sky lines, using the OpenCV library.
  3. Cropping an image according to the average value of the sky lines.

# Result
